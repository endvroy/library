# Library Management System

This is the interface of a hypothetical library management system. It is built with Pyhton 3 and Kivy, and assumes MySQL is used as the database.

The interface features simplicism design, and supports the querying, borrowing and returning of books. The administrators have a special interface, allowing them to manage the library.
